It was most likely cause by the heavy rain Wednesday night. The mudslide blocked a stretch of Scotts Valley Road. A state trooper said the mud slide down the hill and piled up to six inches high. People who live on Scotts Valley Road said mudslides happen every time there is heavy rain fall and the county does not do anything about it. Neighbors said the mudslide comes with the threat of car and motorcycle accidents. Stevens County said that because not many people live there they cannot afford to change the road.They said on any given day only 45 people travel down the unpaved road. The County said they do maintenance on the road so mudslides do not happen every time it rains.   A County Engineer said the road is up to code for normal storms but there is not enough money in the budget to prepare every road in the county for the worst of storms.

A wet winter paired with a lot of recent rainfall has resulted in multiple mudslides in Clallam County, which is normal for this time of year, said Ross Tyler, Clallam County engineer.  “The ground is saturated, and we got a big dump [of rain],” Tyler said.  Lake Sutherland's South Shore Road was temporarily closed at about noon Thursday at a location three-quarters of a mile from U.S. Highway 101 when trees and mud slid across the road, completely covering it, he said.  Crews cleared and reopened part of the road, allowing for one lane of traffic into the neighborhood on the south side of Lake Sutherland, which Tyler said has no other access.

The slide happened near Rich Bar just after 2 a.m. and has forced the closure of eastbound Highway 70 at Big Bend Road in Butte County and westbound at Greenville Wye in Plumas County. Drivers are urged to seek an alternative route.  Caltrans officials say a geotechnical review of the highway must be conducted and as a result the road may be closed for two to three days.

The CHP closed the outermost two lanes about 1 p.m. and dispatched cleanup crews, Montoya said. The lanes are scheduled to reopen by 6 p.m., and crews are working to clean up the mud before commuters hit the freeway later Wednesday, he said.

The Park Service plans to remove about 18,000 cubic yards, and leave the rest to blend into the landscape. The slide covered about 20 parked vehicles and damaged dozens of bicycles kept at the landing for renting to visitors. An historic shed at the Imus Cabin filled with water and mud, and mud also encroached on a public laundry building. Hires said damages to the laundry and shower building were only minor.

An ODOT spokesman says they are hoping to have all lanes open before the Wednesday afternoon rush. He added that ""several hundred cubic yards"" of dirt and debris fell, most of it mud.

The owner of the home did not want to talk on camera but he said off camera that he will have to remove his deck. He has also hired erosion control workers, who have already draped the hillside below with tarp to deflect as much rain as possible.

State geologists said it may be early, but now is the time for homeowners to make sure water is not being diverted onto the slopes around their homes.

Susan Lent, Caltrans PIO, said that hard closures were set northbound at Coso Rest Area and southbound at Olancha.   Thursday, traffic was backed up in both directions on 395. In late afternoon, there was no estimate of when the highway would re-open or if a detour would be available. Caltrans Director Tom Hallenbeck said that it was estimated that a four-foot wall of mud and mudslide-truckdebris  200 yards wide had washed onto the highway.  Reports continued to come in that a heavy flow of water relentlessly flowed down from a canyon area in the Sierra.  Caltrans and others continued the tough job to try to clear all the debris.

Los Angeles Department of Water and Power crews have been sent to assist at the scene. The mud covered real estate signs and driveways.  “It was about 12:20 this morning,” Okita said, “and it sounded like rain was coming down.

The road, a scenic, serpentine 4-mile byway between Foresthill Road and Highway 49 east of Auburn, was shut down at 5 p.m. Wednesday after rock and mud covered part of the road. It remained closed Thursday with a county Public Works Department roads maintenance division crew working with heavy equipment to remove the partial obstruction.  Kevin Taber, engineering manager of the roads maintenance division, said that plans were to keep the road closed to traffic overnight Thursday due to the possibility of more rockslides during forecast rainstorms. The road also was closed from Jan. 6 to Friday because of a slide.  “With impending heavy rains, still more material could come down,” Taber said.  Concrete barriers were put in place Friday to hold back falling rocks but the debris had piled over them during Wednesday’s storm onto Old Foresthill Road.

A culvert pipe leaked and caused the side of the hill under the road to be saturated with water, according to Apple Tree Point Lane resident Gordon Becker. He estimates the leaky pipe has been in place since the 1980s.  “If the pipe hadn’t leaked, we wouldn’t be doing this now,” Becker said. He also thinks recent heavy rains played a factor in the slide; Kingston received almost 10 inches of rain in the 10 days prior to the slide, according to weather.com.  “If you impact the hill with that much water, it’s going to move,” Becker said.  Crews were on site making repairs Dec. 16. Some residents were able to park their vehicles above the slide, allowing them foot access to the main road.  Becker said there was a slide near the same area just a few years ago.

A larger slide occurred at 10:40 p.m. Thursday night and brought down mud, rocks and debris across all westbound lanes. The slide pushed debris up against the jersey barrier separating the west- and eastbound lanes. There are no plans to close the eastbound lanes at this time, but crews are closely monitoring conditions.","Westbound lanes of State Route 18, Auburn, WA",1km,landslide,downpour,medium,unknown,0.0,,,,,glc,1399.0,United States,US,Washington,70180.0,Auburn,2.10892,06/28/2016 03:18:00 PM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-122.2555,47.3031,1,2010

They immediately stopped the water flow through the canal and around 4 a.m. Tuesday morning crews found the crack.  The canal broke about 1.5 miles downstream from Rollins Lake above the Bear River, which is about 5 miles north of Colfax. The canal is in very steep terrain, and after the sidewall cracked water started spilling out.  PG&E told FOX40 they had just patrolled the area of the crack on April 1st by foot after the recent storms, and at that time found no potential threats.

On Monday night, a small landslide sent mud down a steep hill and into a garage. Clackamas County firefighters say the damage wasn't major and there were no reported injuries.  However, some residents have decided to leave for fear that a much bigger slide is on its way.  Geologists went to the site Tuesday morning to check the hill's stability. Crews say the hill is unstable, but there is no indication that there would be a massive slide.  Monday night's slide brought down several small trees and caused some damage to the roof of the garage.  Crews have roped off a section of land near the slide. The manager of a nearby apartment complex says he put up a large tarp on his property in early January to prevent a washout.

Highway 99, south of Salmon Creek, WA","Torrential rains over the weekend are being blamed for a landslide that has undermined one lane of Highway 99 south of Salmon Creek.  Clark County road crews on Monday closed one southbound lane at least until next week, giving them enough time to shore up 25 feet of embankment. Officials expect the repair will cost about $150,000.  “We need to re-establish the integrity of the slope,” said Greg Shafer, operations manager for Clark County Public Works.  Shafer said the lane may remain closed until the end of next week. Additional lane restrictions are possible during paving and repairs.  The highway includes two lanes in each direction, with a center turn lane.  Officials suspect stormwater runoff from heavy rain on Sunday flowed through old guardrail post holes on the west side of the highway, triggering the landslide. A nearby business reported the issue on Monday, prompting the lane closure.  The nearest business is Pioneer Fence, Deck and Supply Co., 11318 N.E. Highway 99. ","near 11318 N.E.
